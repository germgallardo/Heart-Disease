# Heart-Disease

Heart Disease project based on a Kaggle Dataset.

Starting with several clinical parameters of a patient, we need to predict whether or not they have heart disease. The independent variables will be used to predict the target variable.

The objective is to try to reach an accuracy of 95% at predicting if a certain patient has heart disease.
